# Black-Scholes-(with-Python & Excel)

The Black-Scholes model is a mathematical model used to calculate the theoretical price of European-style options, which are financial derivatives that give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset at a predetermined price within a certain period of time.

The model was developed by Fischer Black and Myron Scholes in the 1970s and won them the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1997. The model takes into account the price of the underlying asset, the time until expiration, the strike price, the risk-free interest rate, and the volatility of the underlying asset. It assumes that the underlying asset's price movements follow a random walk, meaning they cannot be predicted with certainty.

The Black-Scholes model has become a standard tool for valuing options and other financial derivatives, and it has been widely used in the fields of finance and economics. However, it does have some limitations, such as assuming constant volatility, no dividends, and a risk-free interest rate, which can affect the accuracy of its predictions in real-world situations.
